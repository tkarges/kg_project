    "aim_of_module": "As “big data” and “algorithms” affect our daily communication,\nnew research questions arise at the intersection between societies\nand technologies. Many of these questions are of great social rele-\nvance and are therefore prominently discussed both by research-\ners and in the media. One outstanding, recent example from the\nfield of media psychology is a rising interest in the association of\n(social) media use and mental health. Another example, from the\nrealm of political communication, is the ongoing debate about the\nrole of new communication technologies during political campaigns\n(e.g., to spread disinformation). Both questions revolve around the\nprocess of communication. Sound research in this area thus re-\nquires both a solid foundation from communication theory as well\nas expertise in handling new and “big” data. To close this gap, the\ngrowing discipline of Computational Communication Science (CCS)\ntakes on a combinatory perspective between social and computer\nscience. The present course will provide an overview about the cur-\nrent state of CCS and intends to motivate students to approach\npressing social questions from a different perspective.\nLearning outcomes and\nqualification goals\nExpertise:\nAfter the course the students are aware of the typical research top-\nics and questions in automated media content analyses and the dif-\nferent methodological approaches for tackling them; they know\nthe different methods’ potentials, limitations, and typical fields of\napplication; they are able to develop their own specific research\nquestions and can make an informed decision about which method\nto apply for answering it (MK3).\n94\n\n\nMethodological competence:\nStudents are able to independently develop a research question\nand design in the area of automated media content analysis and\ncan conduct a respective analysis using one of the different meth-\nodological approaches introduced in the exercise; they are able to\ndocument the results of their analyses in a research report and re-\nflect upon their findings’ limitations with regards to reliability and\nvalidity.\n(MF1, MF2, MF3, MF4, MF5)\nPersonal competence:\nThe course supports students to develop problem-solving compe-\ntences with regards to research-design oriented questions. By solv-\ning exercises independently, the transfer of the learned material to\nrelated questions is promoted and self-confidence with regards to\nresearch-oriented tasks is gathered (MKO3).",

The courses are divided in five groups - Data Science Fundamentals,\nData Management, Data Analytics Methods, Responsible Data Science, and Data Science Ap-\nplications. After studying the fundamentals of Data Sciences, students will then learn how to\nmanage, analyse, and responsibly handle data. Furthermore, they will learn about the differ-\nent applications of data science in computer science, social sciences, or business and eco-\nnomics. In addition to the regular lecture courses, students participate in a one or two se-\nmester team project or individual project.\nKnowledge\nDuring their studies -\n(MK1)\nall students develop a deep understanding of the relevant concepts, methods\nand problem solving strategies used in different application domains.\n(MK2)\ntechnology-oriented students learn the concepts, algorithms and strategies\nused to solve concrete, practical application-oriented problems in informatics.\n(MK3)\nsocial sciences-oriented students develop a deep understanding of how to set\nup, analyse and interpret advanced empirical research questions.\nAs part of this education, students become familiar with a wide range of models, modelling\nlanguages, methods, and tools. Regardless of their specialization, students also learn how to\ncollect, structure, manipulate, prepare, interpret, communicate, and use data, information\nand knowledge.\n\n\n141\n\nCapabilities\nAfter completing their studies, students have the ability to –\n(MF1)\napply a wide range of abstraction and analysis techniques.\n(MF2)\nunderstand, interpret, describe and present relevant scientific publications.\n(MF3)\nexploit the latest scientific results.\n(MF4)\nindependently tackle problems in data management and analytics and de-\nscribe their results in a structured, written form.\n(MF5)\ncontinue their studies at the PhD level, if their results are of sufficient quality.\nCompetencies\nAfter completing their studies, students have the competences needed to –\n(MKO1)\napply their knowledge and capabilities to solve specific problems in a team\ncontext.\n(MKO2)\nuse their interdisciplinary education to mediate between technical and non-\ntechnical individuals.\n(MKO3)\nevaluate the latest changes in programming languages, systems, models and,\nwherever possible, exploit them to develop better solutions to data-science\nrelated problems."
